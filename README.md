FEAPpv -- a free personal version of the FEAP

FEAPpv is a simplifed version of FEAP and does not included many advanced features such as a parallel capability, contact, fe2, igafeap. It only supports a limited number of material models. The programming architecture of FEAPpv is generally similar to that of FEAP but often is a bit behind in development. The official website of FEAPpv can be found at http://projects.ce.berkeley.edu/feap/feappv. To compile and build FEAPpv from the source code in this repository, see http://feap.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php/Installation. 

The FEAPpv source code in this repository is an updated version with some corrections not avaialbe in the official version. For exmaple, the neoh3h(\*) subroutine for Neo-Hookean hyperelastic material model has been updated.
