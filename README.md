FEAPpv -- a free personal version of the FEAP

FEAPpv is a simplifed version of FEAP and does not included many advanced features such as a parallel capability, contact, fe2, igafeap. It only supports a limited number of material models. The programming architecture of FEAPpv is generally similar to that of FEAP but often is a bit behind in development. The official website of FEAPpv can be found at http://projects.ce.berkeley.edu/feap/feappv.
